# Wii U Reboot

This is a really simple app that just restarts your console. When used with things like the Aroma ftp plugin it's surprisingly convenient though :P

## Building

To build this make sure you have `devkitPro`, `devkitPPC` and `wut` installed via the dkp-pacman package manager. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and use the resulting wuhb.
